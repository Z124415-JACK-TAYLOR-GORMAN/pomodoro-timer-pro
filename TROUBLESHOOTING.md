## Troubleshooting

### HTTP Error 403: Forbidden

If you are getting an HTTP Error 403 when trying to download videos, it is likely that YouTube is blocking the requests. To fix this, you can use a cookie file from your browser.

1.  Install a browser extension that can export cookies, such as "Get cookies.txt" for Chrome or "cookies.txt" for Firefox.
2.  Go to youtube.com and log in to your account.
3.  Click the extension icon and export the cookies as a `cookies.txt` file.
4.  In the Pomodoro Timer application, paste the full path to the `cookies.txt` file in the "Path to cookies.txt (optional)" field.
